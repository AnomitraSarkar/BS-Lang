# 📜 BSLang

**BSLang** is a Gen-Z inspired toy programming language designed to be expressive, fun, and functionally capable. With meme-driven syntax and semantics, it aims to make programming both entertaining and educational.

## Installation

Clone github repo in your local system

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnomitraSarkar/BS-Lang.git
```

Set Path to environment variables (relative to installation path)

```bash
BS-Lang\SCRIPTS\
```

To check if working or not

```bash
bs
```

## Working

BS-Lang\examples contain example programs to test and run with, refer below in the docs to get used to the programming language.

To check if working or not

```bash
bs -shell
```

To run bs file

```bash
bs <file.bs>
```

To run bs file and print the ast tree and token associated by parser

```bash
bs -ast -token <file.bs>
```

## ✅ Current Functionalities (aka what Delulu can do rn)

### ✨ Core Syntax and Semantics

- `sigma`: Declare a variable like a sigma male 🧠 — because alpha is too mainstream.
- `cook`: Function declaration — chef mode activated 🍳.
- `gyatt()`: Call a function with max rizz 👑 — ultimate slay.
- `hawk_tuah(...)`: Print it LOUD like your crush just texted back 📢.
- `rizz_check` / `nah_fam`: If you got the rizz, do this; otherwise, hard pass 😎.
- `flex`: Infinite loop flex session 💪 — never stop, won’t stop.
- `yap i till x to y`: For loop that speaks fluent Gen-Z 🧢.
- `yeet`: Return the value straight into the void 🚀.
- `skibidi`: End a function with a little dance-off 🎤.
- `slay`, `cap`: Boolean truths and lies 💅 — certified facts only.
- `frfr`, `maybe`, `nah`: Logic squad — AND, OR, and a full 180 🌀.
- `nvm`, `delulu`, `sus`: Null, undefined, and the imposter among us 🤨.
- `on_read{...}`: Comments with ✨aesthetic✨ — journaling your code.

### 🧠 Tokenization & Lexing

- Support for numbers, strings, identifiers
- Operators and comparisons
- Keywords and emoji-core logic

### 🔁 Control Flow

- Supports recursion like a philosophy major 🤯
- Loops that just keep looping 😵
- Mutating variables like a shapeshifter
- Full arithmetic + logic support

## ⚠️ Is BSLang Turing Complete?

Yes... **in theory**. Like that group project teammate who _could_ do everything, but you know they won't 😩

> "BSLang is Turing complete in theory, but in practice she's still working on herself 💅🛠️."

So yes — we checked the nerdy boxes ✅ but if you try to build Skynet with it right now, she might just `yeet` herself.

## 🔧 Missing Functionalities for Practical Turing Completeness

### ❗ Standard Library (because vibes need functions)

- A standard library is essential to make BSLang usable in practice.
- Math utilities, string manipulation, data structures like lists/maps
- Utility functions: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`, `random`
- Standard input/output wrappers
- Time and date support (so we know when to `slay`)

### ❗ Arrays and Memory Extended Functionalities

- Hashmaps and Set etc
- Dynamic arrays and nested structures
- `len(arr)` support and iteration

### ❗ First-Class Functions

- Passing functions as arguments (yes, like actual functions 😭)
- Returning functions
- Anonymous functions (bonus points for ✨ aesthetic syntax ✨)

### ❗ Input/Output

- Read user input (`gimme()`) or equivalent
- File I/O (optional but 🔥)
- Proper STDIN/STDOUT stream handling

### ❗ Interpreter Runtime Buff

- Remove recursion limits
- Allow deep call stacks
- Add tail call optimization (for the real nerds)

### ❗ Error Handling (a.k.a. emotional support)

- `panik` for try/catch semantics
- Null-safe comparisons and default values

### ❗ Optional Vibes

- `eval()` for runtime code gen (yes this is chaotic, we support it)
- Garbage collection
- REPL or live console (so you can vibe-test code live)

## 🤝 Open Source Vibes

BSLang is totally open source — because gatekeeping isn’t slay. Contributions are welcome whether you want to fix bugs, add features, or just inject more meme magic.

- Found a bug? Squash it like a cap.
- Got a feature idea? Let’s manifest it together.
- Wanna vibe with the code? Fork it, slay it, PR it.
