okay there is one more change if i write sigma/tweet x gimme("Enter the number") 
then the input would be taken as either number or string accordingly. the list is dynamic so no need for explicit declaration there but yes there is apparently a new keyword where tweet = string apparently can be used as of now focus on the gimme type cast, if possible add the functionality to interpret sigma x as int x (like before) and tweet x as string, make the necessary changes properly
